### Hi there 👋

### Welcome to my Github personal page 😃

🙋‍♂️ I'm Matias, 21 years old. I was born and raised in Ecuador 🇪🇨

🕺 I've always loved to exercise 🏋️, play sports 🏐⚽️🎾, listen to music 🎧, watch films and series 🎬, spend time with my family and friends 🍻, 

🤓 But above all, I love to learn 📖, specially about history 📜, politics 🗣, psychology 🧠, science 🧪 and technology 💻.

🧑‍💻 I started pogrmaming when I was 14 years old (stopped for a couple of years to focus on my now failed carrer as a professional volleyball player 🤪)

🎓 Once I finished highschool, I decided I wanted to study abroad 🗺. That's why I moved to Portugal 🇵🇹 at 17 for college and in 2021 I earned my Computer Engineering Bsc degree from the Polytechnic of Leiria.

💼 In September, 2021 I moved to Porto and I've been working at Deloitte Portugal as a Junior Programmer in the Financial Services area ever since.

📚 During my free I'm learning about Cloud solutions ☁️, iOS development 📱 and Python 🐍.

💿 Here you'll be able to find some of my personal and university projects. Feel free to take a look and ask questions if you feel to. 😉
