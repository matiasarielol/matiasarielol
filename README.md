### Hi there 👋

I'm Matias, 21 years old, born and raised in Ecuador 🇪🇨

I've always loved to exercise 🏋️, play sports 🏐⚽️🎾, listen to music , watch films and series, spend time with my family and friends, but above all, I've always been a person that loves to learn, some of the topics that I've always be curious about are: History, Politics, Psychology and Technology.

I started pogrmaming small scripts when I was 14 years old (stopped for a couple of years to focus on my now failed carrer as a professional volleyball player)

Once I finished highschool, I decided I wanted to study abroad. That's why I moved to Portugal at 17 for college and in 2021 I earned my Computer Engineering Bsc degree from the Polytechnic of Leiria.

And since September, 2021 I've been working at Deloitte Portugal as a Junior Programmer in the Financial Services area.

I'm now learning about Cloud, Java and iOS.

💬 You can ask me about Java, iOS, Cloud, volleyball.
