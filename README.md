### 😃 About me
🧑‍💻 I started programming simple scripts when I was 14 years old, but stopped for couple of years to focus on my now over career as a professional volleyball player 🤪.
Then, after high school, I decided to study the university abroad, and that's how at the age of 17 I moved to 🇵🇹 Portugal to purse my dream, which I ended up achieving in 2021 when I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic of Leiria 🎓.

💼 In September, 2021 I moved to Porto to work at Deloitte Portugal as a Junior Programmer in the Financial Services area.
