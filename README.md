## Hi there 👋  Welcome to my Github personal page!

🙋‍♂️ I'm Matias, I'm 21 and I love computer science.

💿 On this repository you'll be able to find some of my personal and university projects. 

### 😃 About me
I started programming when I was 14 years old 🧑‍💻, but stopped a couple of years to focus on my now failed career as a professional volleyball player 🤪.
Then, after high school, I decided to study the university abroad, and that's how at the age of 17 I moved to Portugal 🇵🇹 to purse my dream, which I ended up achieving in 2021 when I earned my bachelor’s degree in Computer Engineering at the Polytechnic of Leiria 🎓.

💼 In September, 2021 I moved to Porto and since then I have been working at Deloitte Portugal as a Junior Programmer in the Financial Services area.
